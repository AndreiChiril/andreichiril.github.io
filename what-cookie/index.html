	<h2>What are these?</h2>
	<p><i>Cookies are a small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website.<br>
	Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past).<br>
	They can also be used to remember pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers.</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">Wikipedia</a>)<br>
	Google Analytics, the tool used in this website that uses cookies, is used to see:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How many visitors are viewing this website</li>
		<li>When do you visit this website</li>
		<li>Where do you visit this website</li>
		<li>On what device do you visit this website</li>
		<li>What pages do you visit</li>
	</ul>
