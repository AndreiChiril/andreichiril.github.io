What is PeerTube?

2
00:00:01.872 --> 00:00:04.153
Peertube is an open-source video platform.

3
00:00:04.153 --> 00:00:06.549
Like YouTube or Vimeo

4
00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.409
you can watch, comment

5
00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:10.106
and upload videos online,

6
00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:11.606
but there's more...

7
00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:14.364
it empowers you to be more than a user!

8
00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:16.678
You can make the web yours,

9
00:00:16.678 --> 00:00:18.856
by installing your own PeerTube!

10
00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:20.256
Federation

11
00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.660
PeerTube instances can sync together.

12
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.501
When Meow-tube chooses to sync with Dog-tube,

13
00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:27.997
all of Dog-tube videos

14
00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:29.921
can be watched on Meow-tube!

15
00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:32.996
The video files stay on Dog-tube server

16
00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:34.119
while being streamed

17
00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:36.313
simultaneously to Meow-tube.

18
00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:38.259
This federation approach

19
00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.055
creates a video network

20
00:00:39.855 --> 00:00:41.555
with shared video-catalog

21
00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:44.056
without paying for more disk space.

22
00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.425
This is the base of the web!

23
00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:49.005
P2P streaming

24
00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:50.938
You don't need a data-center

25
00:00:50.938 --> 00:00:52.213
to run PeerTube.

26
00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:54.146
When someone watches a video,

27
00:00:54.146 --> 00:00:55.446
it is streamed directly

28
00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:57.212
from the PeerTube instance.

29
00:00:57.697 --> 00:00:58.813
When several people watch

30
00:00:58.813 --> 00:01:00.515
simultaneously the same video,

31
00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:02.835
bits of the video are shared

32
00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:04.452
between them in the background.

33
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:05.994
Peer-to-peer streaming

34
00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:07.694
makes video streaming resilient

35
00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:09.460
and efficent:

36
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.590
a successful video

37
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.241
shouldn't bring an instance down.

38
00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:15.005
User freedom

39
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:16.578
Peertube is an open-source software

40
00:01:16.578 --> 00:01:18.889
with community-driven development.

41
00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.538
Institutions, medias, communities,

42
00:01:21.538 --> 00:01:24.436
anyone can make their own videotube,

43
00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:26.755
with their own rules, at a low cost.

44
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:28.372
In the long run,

45
00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:30.240
you'll be able to find and join

46
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.938
the Peertube instance that really suits you.

47
00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:34.738
Make the web yours again,

48
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.583
get its control back,

49
00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:36.933
one video at a timeâ€¦

50
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.536
just join PeerTube:

51
00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:40.151
