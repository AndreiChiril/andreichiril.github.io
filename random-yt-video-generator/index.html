	<p>This random YouTube video generator generates a video ID that's 1 in 73 786 976 294 838 206 464. (73 quintillion 786 quadrillion 976 trillion 294 billion 838 million 206 thousand 464) (If every person on Earth uploaded a video every minute, it would take around 18 000 years for YouTube to run out of IDs)<br>
	<b>Copyright notice:</b> this is a random YouTube video generator. Because of this, your videos may be shown here. The rate is extremely low, though, so the videos made by you are extremely unlikely to be shown here.<br>
	<b>For people with a lot of spare time:</b> I wish you the best of luck finding an available YouTube video. <!--Make a screenshot of the page, post it on <a href="">the official Discord server of the website</a> and you may get a prize!--></p>
